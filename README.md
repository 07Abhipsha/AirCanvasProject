# AirCanvasProject
Air Canvas Project: This is a project based on Machine Learning.
Requirements: python3 , numpy , opencv
# How it works:
You can draw anything on your screen with your finger moving in the air.
This will track your finger(specifically a particular color which acts as a bead). 
When you move your finger in air, your web cam will capture the motion and produce it on the screen.
You can also change the color of the bead and clear the screen by moving your finger in te screen.

Here Colour Detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. 
The colour marker in detected and a mask is produced.
